### Building plans

1. As in [Slip Through](https://github.com/TytusKolpak/SlipThroughGame) I think this one can be build in 5x6 grid, divded into 3 "Acts" of 2 rows.
2. Every fight will not be automatic, but rather than that will work simillar to the [Shooter](https://github.com/TytusKolpak/Shooter) game in Golang.
