# Slip through2

This project is a successor game to my previous [Slip Through](https://github.com/TytusKolpak/SlipThroughGame), which was created using Windows Forms (xd). This one still uses C# but with MonoGame this time which is much more appropriate and hopefully will allow me to make a better game.

## Building overview - initial idea

1. As in [Slip Through](https://github.com/TytusKolpak/SlipThroughGame) I think this one can be build in 3x6 grid, divided into 3 "Acts" - one per row.
2. Every fight will not be automatic, but rather than that will work similar to the [Shooter](https://github.com/TytusKolpak/Shooter) game in Golang.
